## How It Works

Moravian students are greeted to a homepage where they can log in with their university email accounts.

Once logged in, the user can then select one of two dining locations from the Moravian campus, "The B&G Cafe" or "DeLight's Cafe". They can select these locations and be presented a list of various food vendors from that location.

Once a vendor is selected, they can then select the food they want to leave a review and leave a rating from 1-5.
